# Quoridor-Game

A 2-player Pygame version of the table-top boardgame named Quoridor.

##Rules
A general summar of the game can be viewed here [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ISruhN0Hc0). This version is played on a 9x9 board where player 1 is represented by the white pawn and player 2 the grey pawn. You can move by clicking on a valid horizontal or vertical space that is one place over from the pawn's current position. To place a fence, you would have to hover over the desired square with the mouse and press the h key for horizontal placement or v key for vertical placement. Each player will have 10 fences to use. These three actions all require a turn, so each player must account for their actions. Once the player is at the opposing player's goal line, that player can press 1 if they are player 1 to declare a win or 2 if they are player 2.
